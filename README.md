# FrontEnd/BackEnd Project
<i>Task Description: Create a dynamic web app in ReactJS. You need to use MySQL database and Django rest framework as backend. </i>

#Approach to the project: 
1. The first Assignment was to make an overall outline of the project's Backend EndPoints, To figure that out, here is my rough docs link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_PcqgPKHGHA5GHkGZ2sXKFsqFdKbm66sKv-66LroqsI/edit?usp=sharing .
2. <i>(Successful with the task)</i>
3. The second approach was to figure out how to use Django Rest framework and connect it with React. The reason behind it was that Django was not my Stack which I used before, so it was my first time. The default framework I use is Express and Node with EJS as BackEnd. Also, my main Language was Java at this point of time, so I had to learn basic Python syntax.
4. <i>(Successful with the task)</i>
5. The Third task I had was to set up a Django project- install Python, pip, set up a virtual environment and test the server. Learn about how Django files work. Firstly I got very confused related to files in the Django project, since Express and Node use few files but here it's very different but DOable.
6. <i>(Successful with the task)</i>
7. Made my first Test API.
8. <i>(Successful with the task)</i>
9. Setting up the database: since Django uses default sql lite server as the database, I transferred it to SQL databases to perform CRUD operations. Migrated all the data.
10. <i>(Successful with the task)</i>
11. Setting up Admin panel for Django framework, made some test events.
12. <i>(Successful with the task)</i>
13. Next Step was the frontEnd: Installed react, made the firstdefault landing page.
14. <i>(Successful with the task)</i>
15. I Connected all the endpoints for the backend and the frontend for basic landing page.
16. <i>(Successful with the task)</i>
17. Figure out how to link images from the database to the frontend
18. <i>(Failed the task)</i>
19. Figured out and Fixed CORS error
20. <i>(Successful with the task)</i>
21. Figure out Redirect to Login Page, Registration page and user authentication system, add event from frontend (able to implement in the backend but not in frontend)
22. <i>(Failed the task due to time restrain)</i>
23. Able to make the backend for 1.Global: Where all events created by any user are visible 2.User Specifc: Only events created by the current logged in user should be visible (If no user is logged in, this tab should not be visible)
24. <i>(Successful with the task)</i>
25. Figure out global and user specific frontend
26. <i>(Failed the task due to time constrain)</i>
27. <i>Images Related the project<i>

Improved idea for the project: Instead of this:
1. Create a table with fields as (‘event_name’, ’data’ ,’time’, ‘location’ ,’image’, ‘is_liked’, ‘user_id’).
By default, is_liked is false.
Create a form to add a new event/entry to the database for the specific user
I tried to implement this: since adding is_liked to every post, it will create multiple events to each posts which will be made for all the users.
A better implementation would be making userid and islike in another database

To the company- Thank you for the opportunity: I would like to go forward with Django Rest framework with React and complete this project as my next full stack task and improve my code.
